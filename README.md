This repository includes some simple example of design pattern corresponding to the [_design_pattern.md_](https://github.com/VincentLiLab/Tech_Insights/blob/master/languages/design_pattern.md).

How to compile:

* make sure cmake is installed.
* make sure Clang 14.0.0 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu is installed. if there is not that version, the version you have needs to be modified in the CMakePresets.json.
* mkdir build in the root directory.
* cd build.
* cmake ../
* cmkae --build .
* ctest.
